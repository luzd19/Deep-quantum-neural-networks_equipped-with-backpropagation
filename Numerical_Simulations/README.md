# Description for this folder:

We numerically simulate the training of deep quantum neural networks on several different tasks: learning a two-qubit quantum channel, learning the ground state energy of the molecular hydrogen Hamiltonian,  and learning a one-qubit quantum channel. 

Here, we provide the codes for numerical simulations, and the numerical results.
