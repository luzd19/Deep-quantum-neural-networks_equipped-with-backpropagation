# This folder stores the main data collected during the experiments as well as the corresponding codes for plotting the figures in the main text of our paper

We experimentally train deep quantum neural networks on several different tasks: learning a two-qubit quantum channel, learning the ground state energy of the molecular hydrogen Hamiltonian,  and learning a one-qubit quantum channel. 

Here, we provide the experiment results, and the codes for plotting the figures.
